# labelmetoyolo
convert labelme json format to yolo format for object detect and segmentation
Thanks source code from https://github.com/rooneysh/Labelme2YOLO
I have edited a bit so that there is no need to create an image file from the image data in the json file, the image will be copied directly from the root directory, making the conversion process faster, keeping the input image format.
